## **1. Concept of Encapsulation**

Encapsulation = **"Wrapping data (variables) and methods (logic) that operate on the data into a single unit"** and controlling how the data is accessed from outside.

Think of it as **data hiding + controlled access**.

* **Data hiding**: We keep fields `private` so that no outside class can directly modify them.
* **Controlled access**: We provide `public` getters/setters (or other methods) to control how outside code interacts with our data.

It‚Äôs like keeping valuables in a locker (private) and only giving a **controlled key** to trusted people.

---

## **2. Why is Encapsulation important?**

* **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access or invalid data.
* **Flexibility**: You can change the internal implementation without affecting other classes.
* **Maintainability**: Code is easier to manage and debug.
* **Validation**: You can check or modify data before storing it.

## **3. Syntax Structure**

```java
class BankAccount {
    // 1. Private variables (Data hiding)
    private String accountHolder;
    private double balance;

    // 2. Constructor to initialize
    public BankAccount(String accountHolder, double balance) {
        this.accountHolder = accountHolder;
        setBalance(balance); // using setter for validation
    }

    // 3. Getter (read-only access)
    public String getAccountHolder() {
        return accountHolder;
    }

    // 4. Setter with validation
    public void setBalance(double balance) {
        if (balance >= 0) {
            this.balance = balance;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid balance! Cannot be negative.");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Business logic method
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println(amount + " deposited. New balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount.");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(amount + " withdrawn. New balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid withdraw amount.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount("Sahi", 5000);

        // Direct access to variables is not possible:
        // acc.balance = -1000; // ‚ùå Compilation error

        // Controlled access:
        acc.deposit(2000);
        acc.withdraw(1000);

        // Trying invalid operation:
        acc.setBalance(-500); // ‚ùå Won't set due to validation
    }
}
```

**Output (sample):**

```
2000 deposited. New balance: 7000.0
1000 withdrawn. New balance: 6000.0
Invalid balance! Cannot be negative.
```

## **4. Tricky Interview Questions on Encapsulation**

### **Q1. Is Encapsulation the same as Data Hiding?**

**Trick:** Many think they are the same.
**Answer:**

* **Data hiding** is about restricting direct access to variables by making them `private`.
* **Encapsulation** is a broader concept that includes data hiding *and* bundling data with methods that operate on it.
  So, **data hiding is a subset of encapsulation**.

---

### **Q2. Can we achieve Encapsulation without getters/setters?**

**Trick:** People think getters/setters are mandatory.
**Answer:**
No, they are not mandatory. Encapsulation can be achieved simply by having private fields and providing any method (not necessarily a getter/setter) to control access. For example, you might only allow deposits/withdrawals without giving a getter for balance.

---

### **Q3. Can Encapsulation break if we return a reference to a mutable object?**

**Example:**

```java
class Student {
    private List<String> subjects = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<String> getSubjects() {
        return subjects; // ‚ùå Direct reference breaks encapsulation
    }
}
```

If you return the actual `List`, outside code can modify it directly, bypassing control.
**Solution:** Return an unmodifiable list or a copy.

---

### **Q4. How is Encapsulation different from Abstraction?**

**Trick:** They sound similar.
**Answer:**

* **Encapsulation:** Hides *how* the data is stored and controlled (implementation detail).
* **Abstraction:** Hides *unnecessary details* from the user and shows only relevant features.
  Encapsulation is about **access control**, Abstraction is about **designing an interface**.

---

### **Q5. Can fields be `public` and still be encapsulated?**

**Answer:**
If fields are public, you lose control over validation, so technically it breaks encapsulation. However, if you still route data changes through methods internally, you might keep logic intact ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not recommended.

---

## **1. Returning Mutable Objects Directly**

**Looks safe** ‚Äî private field, getter provided.
**Reality** ‚Äî outsider can still change your data without permission.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Student {
    private List<String> subjects = new ArrayList<>();

    public Student() {
        subjects.add("Math");
        subjects.add("Science");
    }

    public List<String> getSubjects() {
        return subjects; // ‚ùå Returning actual list reference
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        System.out.println("Before: " + s.getSubjects());

        // Modifying directly from outside
        s.getSubjects().add("History"); // Bypasses any validation

        System.out.println("After: " + s.getSubjects());
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Before: [Math, Science]
After: [Math, Science, History]
```

**Why it‚Äôs broken:** External code modified `subjects` without going through a controlled method.

**Fix:**

```java
public List<String> getSubjects() {
    return Collections.unmodifiableList(subjects); // Read-only
}
```

or

```java
return new ArrayList<>(subjects); // Return a copy
```

---

## **2. Using Setters Without Validation**

You *think* you‚Äôre controlling access, but you‚Äôre allowing invalid states.

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void setBalance(double balance) { 
        this.balance = balance; // ‚ùå No validation
    }
}
```

This allows:

```java
acc.setBalance(-9999); // Balance can be negative
```

**Fix:**

```java
public void setBalance(double balance) {
    if (balance >= 0) {
        this.balance = balance;
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Balance cannot be negative");
    }
}
```

---

## **3. Exposing Internal References in Constructors**

Even if your fields are private, passing them by reference breaks encapsulation.

```java
class University {
    private List<String> students;

    public University(List<String> students) {
        this.students = students; // ‚ùå External reference stored
    }
}
```

If the caller modifies their original list, your internal list changes too.

**Fix:** Create a copy in the constructor:

```java
this.students = new ArrayList<>(students);
```

---

## **4. Making Fields `final` But Still Mutable**

Some developers think `final` = safe. Not always.

```java
class Library {
    private final List<String> books = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<String> getBooks() {
        return books; // ‚ùå Still mutable
    }
}
```

You can still do:

```java
library.getBooks().add("New Book");
```

**Fix:** Return unmodifiable list or a copy.

---

## **5. Partially Encapsulated Class**

Encapsulation must be **consistent**. Mixing `public` and `private` for related data is bad.

```java
class Employee {
    public String name; // ‚ùå Not hidden
    private double salary; // ‚úÖ Hidden
}
```

Here, `salary` is protected but `name` is open ‚Äî violates encapsulation principles.

---

## **6. Breaking Encapsulation Through Inheritance**

If you mark fields `protected` in a superclass, subclasses can directly change them.

```java
class Person {
    protected String name; // ‚ùå Accessible to all subclasses
}
```

Better: keep them private and use protected getters/setters if needed.

---

## **7. Immutable Objects That Aren‚Äôt Actually Immutable**

In interviews, they may ask: *"Can you make a truly immutable class?"*
Many fail because they forget **deep copies**.

```java
final class ImmutableStudent {
    private final String name;
    private final List<String> subjects;

    public ImmutableStudent(String name, List<String> subjects) {
        this.name = name;
        this.subjects = subjects; // ‚ùå Direct reference stored
    }

    public List<String> getSubjects() {
        return subjects; // ‚ùå External modification possible
    }
}
```

Fix by making defensive copies in **both constructor and getters**.

---

üí° **Pro Interview Tip:**
If they give you a code snippet and ask ‚ÄúIs this fully encapsulated?‚Äù ‚Äî **always check for:**

1. Mutable object references being returned.
2. Constructor storing references instead of copies.
3. Setters without validation.
4. Protected/public fields that should be private.
5. Mutable objects inside ‚Äúimmutable‚Äù classes.
